# ICue-AI

ICue-AI is a project developed for the GDSC Plot2Deploy Hackathon. It leverages Google Gemini for generative AI and NLP to assist users in identifying dates, events, deadlines for projects and assignment submissions, as well as deadlines for registrations of various events from WhatsApp chats. The app seamlessly integrates with the user's Google Calendar to ensure they never miss important events.

## Features

- **Google Gemini Integration**: Utilizes Google Gemini for generative AI and NLP capabilities.
- **Event Identification**: Automatically identifies dates and events mentioned in WhatsApp chats.
- **Deadline Management**: Helps users keep track of project deadlines, assignment submissions, and event registrations.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Adds identified events and deadlines to the user's Google Calendar for easy reference.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Users can upload the txt file of WhatsApp chats containing dates, events, and deadlines to the ICue-AI app.
2. **Processing**: ICue-AI parses the messages using Google Gemini to identify relevant information such as dates and events.
3. **Integration**: Identified events and deadlines are seamlessly added to the user's Google Calendar.
4. **Notification**: Users receive notifications from Google Calendar to remind them of upcoming events and deadlines.
